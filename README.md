# Cesium
This is the repository where my work on a Cesium app will be stored for sharing

The "HelloGamepadV1.html" file should be in your \CESIUM\Apps directory

Do not forget to download CesiumJS : https://cesium.com/cesiumjs/

And to launch the server in the command prompt with the following : node server.cjs

before launching this app.

To make it work, follow the link given in your command prompt 
i.e. : http://localhost:8080/Apps/HelloGamepad.html


Don't hesitate to tell me if anything goes wrong
